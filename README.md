# ArtGenerator
#### The art style and coveted art pieces of the past can only be bought , sold and displayed once , but new pieces by the same artist can no longer be obtained, through the power of GANs we can generate and create new art pieces in the styles of the artists that we desire, either living or dead. Style transfer can be used to change any image of choice into an art piece using the power of GANs, One input reference image and another target image to have the style transferred on to it.


### ArtGANs trained on hand drawn stickmen.

### ArtGANs trained on around 78 artists over the years.

### Preliminary attempts:
#### If the GANs were trained on single artists work instead of the entire dataset, the results were horid, mainly due to the utter lack of data and the variation in the artists work over time.
